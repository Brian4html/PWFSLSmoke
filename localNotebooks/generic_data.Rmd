# Introduction

In this vignette, we take a look at how the `PWFSLSmoke` package works with
generic air quality data, given a data source and some basic configuration
details telling `PWFSLSmoke` how to interpret the data.


# Downloading Data


## Determining an Acceptable Data Format

First, we need to acquire some example data. AIRSIS provides access to raw data
in a `*.csv` format, one example of which can be downloaded [here][airsis-dl].
These AIRSIS files aren't yet in a format `generic_parseData()` accepts, so we
do some basic data cleaning to ensure each row corresponds to one observation.

```{r clean data, eval=FALSE}

## Note:
#  This section should only be run if a pre-cleaned version of the AIRSIS
#  example data does not already exist.

rawData <- readr::read_csv("localData/airsis_ebam_example-raw.csv")

fillCols <- list("Latitude", "Longitude", "Sys. Volts")

# The raw data consists of data records with no location information interspersed
# with 'GPS' records that have only location and voltate. This next step does
# the following:
#  1) replicate data associated with fillCols so that location information exists
#     in every row
#  2) remove any rows that are missing the "Type" field found in every data record

# NOTE:  '!!!' is tidy unquoting for lists
cleanData <- rawData %>%
  tidyr::fill(!!!fillCols, .direction = "down") %>%
  tidyr::fill(!!!fillCols, .direction = "up") %>%
  filter(!is.na(Type))

# Wow! Using tidyverse packages makes for very expressive code!

readr::write_csv(cleanData, "localData/airsis_ebam_example-clean.csv")

```

In general, `PWFSLSmoke` expects generic data to adhere to a few specific rules:

 * Each row corresponds to an observation at a single point in time
 * All of the required columns from the configuration list exist
 * Header rows only exist at the top of the file


## Get the Data

`generic_downloadData()` accepts a file path an argument. This path can be
either a local file path or a remote connection (such as `http://`, `https://`,
`ftp://`, or `ftps://). For this example, we will use a local file.

```{r download data}

filePath <- file.path("..", "localData", "airsis_ebam_example-clean.csv")
#fileString <- generic_downloadData(filePath)

```

The output of this function is the file, stored as a single string ready to be
parsed by `generic_parseData()`.


# Defining a Configuration List

```{r create configuration}

configurationList <- list(
  headerRows = 1,
  columnTypes = "dcddc-dddddddddddc--dcc",
  requiredColumnNames = list(
    datetime = "",
    pm25 = ""
  ),
  extraColumnNames = list(
    monitorID = "",
    latitude = "",
    longitude = "",
    siteName = ""
  ),
  timezone = "UTC",
  decimalMark = ".",
  groupingMark = ",",
  deliminator = "|",
  encoding = "UTF-8"
)

```
