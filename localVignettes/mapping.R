# In the summer of 2015 we had catastrophic wildfire in Washington, whilch then led to heavy smoke in the
# surrounding towns for quite a few days. Visualizing smoke data can have vital importance by helping
# us understand patterns of wildfire consequences.
# In this report, we would like to show how our mapping functions
# in the PWFSLSmoke package can help us visualize the PM25 data from summer of 2015. To begin, let's have
# a broader look in the regions of Washington, Oregon and Idaho from June 1, 2015 to October 31m 2015.

# So we know that the Idaho county in Idaho had the worst chronic air quality during summer 2015.

# The dot with blue outline is the worst acute location

# As you can see the orange flame is where we had worst acute smoke and the red flame is where we had the worst chronic smoke

# Since we now know the locations with the worst acute and chronic air quality, we can look at their daily average bar plots to

# We can see the unhealthy days are approximately from August 17 to August 29 for the worst acute location, and from August 11 to
# August 29 for the worst Chronic location. These dates also imply that the smoke came from the Okanogan Complex Fire.
# Then we can further zoon in to see the hourly averahe barplot to figure out if there's any pattern of the smoke
# during a day.

# look at hourly pm at specific bad days

# It's easy to see that at the worst acute location, the smoke spiked at around noon from August 23 to August 26.
# And there's no consistent pattern for smoke at the worst chronic location. We can further confirm our observations
# in the below spaghetti plots.

# The spaghetti plot for the worst acute location echos what we discovered in the hourly plot. For the spaghetti plot
# of the worst chronic location, the lines are kind of bouncing up and down in the afternoon.

# Finally we can zoon out to have a bigger picture of the number of unhealthy days by AQI standard among all the counties.

# color counties by number of days for AQI levels
